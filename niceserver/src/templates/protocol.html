            <ul>
                <li>For aesthetic reasons. To make each transaction not just a financial operation, but a brushstroke in the blockchain's grand canvas of mathematical beauty.</li>
                <li>These cascading patterns of zeros would not only create beauty but could also enhance compression, potentially streamlining the blockchain's storage and processing efficiency.</li>
                <li>Anyone can earn RB1TS by creating beautiful transactions - no single-winner-per-block like in Bitcoin block mining!</li>
                <li>If successful, RB1TS tokens could eventually reimburse transaction fees - rewarding those who make nice looking transactions!</li>

            <h3 class="subtitle2">RB1TS mining</h3>
            <p>
                To mine RB1TS you must broadcast a Bitcoin transaction whose txid starts with at least 2 zeros.
                The reward is calculated based on how your transaction compares to the nicest transaction in the block:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In a given block, transactions starting with the most zeros earn 1 RB1TS</li>
                <li>Transactions with one zero less than the best transactions earn 1/16 or 256 RB1TS</li>
                <li>Transactions with two fewer zeros earn 1 / 16 /16 or 16 RB1TS</li>
                <li>etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The formula used is therefore as follows:</p>
            <code>
                reward = 1 / 16 ^ (max_zero_count - zero_count)
            </code>
            <p>
                With `max_zero_count` equal to the number of zeros which start the best transaction 
                and `zero_count` the number of zeros which start the transaction for which we calculate the reward.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> Coinbase transactions are not eligible for RB1TS rewards.

            <h3 class="subtitle2">RB1TS distribution</h3>
            <p>
                RB1TSs earned with a transaction starting with 2 or more zeros are distributed to UTXOs.
                The distribution is carried out as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If there is a single non-OP_RETURN UTXO it receives the entire reward.</li>
                <li>If there are two or more non-OP_RETURN UTXOs, the reward is distributed to all UTXOs, except the last one, in proportion to the value of each UTXO</li>
                <li>The calculations being made only with integers, the possible remainder of the division is distributed to the first non-OP_RETURN UTXO.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For example, if a transaction earning 1 RB1TS contains four outputs of 500, 500, 500 and 2000 satoshis respectively, then the three non-OP_RETURN outputs share the 100 000 000-satoshi reward in proportion to their values: each 500-sat output gets ⌊100 000 000 × (500/1500)⌋ = 33 333 333 sats, and the remaining 1 satoshi (100 000 000 − 3×33 333 333) goes to the first output. In RB1TS units that’s 0.33333334 RB1TS to the first output and 0.33333333 RB1TS to each of the second and third.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle2">Moving RB1TS</h3>
            <p>
                When UTXOs with attached RB1TSs are spent, the RB1TSs are distributed to the new UTXOs in the transaction.
                Distribution is done in exactly the same way as rewards.
